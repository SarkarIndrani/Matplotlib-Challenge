# Matplotlib-Challenge
## Background

I am a senior data analyst in a pharmaceutical company, current working on analyzing the effect of our skin cancer medicine Capomulin on mice. 

249 mice who were identified with squamous cell carcinoma(scc) tumors received treatment with a range of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals' drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regiments.

The management has requested me to analyze the clinical study data and generate a technical report.

- Files: Two CSV files were provided(mouse data and study results). I merged them using outer join and removed duplicates.
